# PARKING LOT SYSTEM
## Overview
A parking lot management system is designed to handle the operations of parking vehicles, collecting payments, and managing available space efficiently. 
The system should be able to accommodate different types of vehicles, provide payment options, and ensure a smooth user experience.

## Rules of the System : 
### Setup:
• The parking lot has multiple slots available for parking.
• Different types of vehicles (bike, car, truck) can occupy different slot sizes.
• Each vehicle is issued a parking ticket upon entry.
• The system calculates the parking fee based on the duration of stay and vehicle type.

### Exit and Payment:
• A vehicle needs to make a payment before exiting.
• Multiple payment methods (Cash, Card, UPI) should be supported.
• Once payment is successful, the vehicle is allowed to exit, and the parking slot is freed.

### Illegal Actions:
• A vehicle cannot park in an already occupied slot.
• Vehicles cannot vacate without completing the payment process.
