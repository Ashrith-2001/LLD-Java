# LLD-Java
## Overview

LLD-Java is a personal repository to collect and practice classic Low-Level Design (LLD) problems with clean Java implementations. 
This project is intended to help me and others reinforce design principles, develop a strong foundation in Java, and serve as a reference for real-world LLD interview problems.

### Purpose

**Practice**: Solve well-known LLD problems to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented design and design patterns in Java.

**Storage**: Serve as a centralized resource for all my LLD problem solutions and reference implementations.

**Learning Resource**: Act as an open resource for anyone looking to see practical Java implementations of foundational LLD topics.

## Structure
Each problem is in its own folder, with:
Problem description (as comments or a markdown file)
1. Java implementation
2. UML or class diagrams (optional)
3. Test/example code (optional)

## How to use This Repository
* Read the README.md in each problem directory for detailed explanations.
* Review code and comments for step-by-step logic.
* Run Java files locally to see outputs and experiment.
* Try extending or modifying implementations to deepen understanding.

## Valuable Insights
* **Why LLD?:** 
    Low-level design is critical for building robust, maintainable, and scalable software.
    Practicing these problems helps you master fundamental concepts that show up in coding interviews and real-world system development.
* **Continuous Growth**: This repository will evolve as I discover more patterns and tackle new problems.
* **Contribution**: If you spot issues or have alternative solutions, feel free to fork or submit a pull request (if you open source it)!
